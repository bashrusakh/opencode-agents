## Startup Block Before Tools

Before the first tool call in any multi-step, repository, codebase, issue/PR/release, external-URL, publication-capable, or scope-expanding workflow, write Markdown only:

```md
### Startup
- Route: `<route>`
- Mode: `<read-only | options | edit-capable | gated>`
- Summary: <one sentence>
- Scope: <target + boundary>
- Gated: `<no | yes>` — <reason>
- Next: <next action/tool>
```

Keep it to this shape. Do not write a prose paragraph. Keep field names in English. Do not use tools first and postpone normalization to the final report.


## Git Sync and PR Branch Provenance

For repository mutation, PR follow-up, commit, push, or PR work, do not trust the current branch by default. Before edits or publication:

```bash
git status --short
git branch --show-current
git fetch origin <base>
git log --oneline --decorate --left-right --cherry-pick origin/<base>...HEAD
git diff --name-status origin/<base>...HEAD
git diff --stat origin/<base>...HEAD
```

Use the project/PR base, defaulting to `origin/main` only when no other base is known. Rebase/update before editing when safe and clean. If the branch contains unrelated commits/files, or rebase/update would rewrite public history or conflict, stop and ask. Do not open/push/update a PR with unrelated work.

## Behavioral Contract Check

For any user-facing UI/config/API/workflow behavior change, do not implement only the data plumbing. Before planning or editing, summarize:

- user-facing action
- value source
- valid-value domain
- existing project pattern to inspect
- whether raw/internal/manual values would be exposed to normal users

Do not derive behavior directly from schema/storage/API type. Preserve the existing affordance class unless the normalized request explicitly asks for a raw/manual/editor workflow.

## User-Facing Output Formatting

For any user-visible answer or published text — final reply, PR/issue/release body, PR review/comment, changelog, handover, plan artifact, or Markdown doc — use readable target-aware Markdown by default.

- Start with a short summary.
- Use headings/sections when there is context, reasoning, validation, conclusion, or next action.
- Use bullets for multiple reasons, risks, checks, files, or decisions.
- Use fenced code blocks for commands, logs, paths, config, or exact proposed text.
- Avoid dense wall-of-text paragraphs.
- For OpenCode CLI, Hermes, Telegram, terminals, or chat relays, prefer compact portable Markdown/plain text; avoid raw HTML, oversized tables, deeply nested lists, and GitHub-only formatting.
- For GitHub/GitLab PRs, issues, releases, and review comments, use clean Markdown with a clear conclusion/next action.

## Persistent Planning Mode

For long-running, multi-session, or multi-agent work, use `plans/<plan>/` as durable state. Read existing plan artifacts before continuing. Do not create arbitrary markdown reports. Use compact digests and update canonical plan/docs artifacts when the command is responsible for planning state.

Propose UI/web redesign options for: $ARGUMENTS

This is options-only. Do not edit code and do not call @frontend-ui-implementer.

Use @explore and @ui-ux-auditor if the current UI needs to be understood.
Use @ui-redesign-planner to produce 2-3 concrete options:

1. Conservative / quick
2. Balanced / recommended
3. Full redesign

For each option include what changes, why it helps, affected screens/components, implementation risk, and estimated scope.

Stop after presenting the options and ask the user which direction to choose.


Read the detailed UI policy file defined in AGENTS.md when it exists.
