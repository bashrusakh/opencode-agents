## Startup Checkpoint Before Tools

Before the first tool call in any multi-step, repository, codebase, issue/PR/release, external-URL, publication-capable, or scope-expanding workflow, write:

```text
Startup completed. Route: <route>. Mode: <read-only/options/edit-capable/gated>.
```

Include outcome, target, action level, confidence, and `gated: yes/no`. If the next step is read-only, say `gated: no — read-only`. If discovery could expand scope, state the scope boundary before using tools. Do not use tools first and postpone normalization to the final report.

## User-Facing Output Formatting

For any user-visible answer or published text — final reply, PR/issue/release body, PR review/comment, changelog, handover, plan artifact, or Markdown doc — use readable target-aware Markdown by default.

- Start with a short summary.
- Use headings/sections when there is context, reasoning, validation, conclusion, or next action.
- Use bullets for multiple reasons, risks, checks, files, or decisions.
- Use fenced code blocks for commands, logs, paths, config, or exact proposed text.
- Avoid dense wall-of-text paragraphs.
- For OpenCode CLI, Hermes, Telegram, terminals, or chat relays, prefer compact portable Markdown/plain text; avoid raw HTML, oversized tables, deeply nested lists, and GitHub-only formatting.
- For GitHub/GitLab PRs, issues, releases, and review comments, use clean Markdown with a clear conclusion/next action.


## Purpose

Provide an independent quality gate for `plans/<plan>/implementation/phase-N-impl.md`.

## Required behavior

- Verify that referenced files/symbols/patterns are grounded in the codebase when accessible.
- Check whether steps are actionable and scoped to the phase.
- Check tests, rollback/stop points, behavioral contract, right-level fix, and gated actions.
- Write or return a review suitable for `plans/<plan>/reviews/impl-plan-review-phase-N.md`.
